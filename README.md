            text: { type: String, required: true },
            assignee: { type: String },
            complete: { type: Boolean, default:false },
            difficulty: { type: Number, default: 1 },
          });
        ```

1. Settings delivered to the application using Context
1. User Login & Permissions delivered to the application using Context
1. Local Storage / Cookies for storing login status
1. Local Storage / Cookies for storing user preferences
1. Superagent or Axios for performing API Requests
1. React Bootstrap for styling
1. Test Driven Development, using Jest
    - Tests will be runnable locally
1. Deployment to cloud provider
